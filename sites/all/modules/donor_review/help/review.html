<h3>How to review dedupe items</h3>
<p>Usually, all items in a work batch have been machine-recommended for the same resolution.  The main goal of reviewing these items is to find instances where the machine may have made a mistake.  Click these rows once to exclude from the automatic resolution.  These rows will be dimmed, and when the spinner completes, your choice has been successfully stored on the server.</p>

<p>Clicking in a cell with differenced contents will cycle between three modes.</p>
<p>
<div style="display: inline-block;"><table><tr><td><del>Lorem ip</del>sum<ins>noo</ins></td><td>The default is to update the record's field contents to the newer version.</td></tr></table></div>
</p>
<p>
<div style="display: inline-block;"><table><tr><td style="background: #99ff99;"><ins>Lorem ip</ins>sum<del>noo</del></td><td>Clicking once will mark the original contents as authoritative, and the cell's background is set to green. The diff is shown backwards, so that the newer contents are crossed out.</td></tr></table></div>
</p>
<p>
<div style="display: inline-block;"><table><tr><td style="background: #ff9999;"><del>Lorem ip</del>sum<ins>noo</ins></td><td>A second click will mark that entry as requiring more in-depth review.</td></tr></table></div>
</p>
