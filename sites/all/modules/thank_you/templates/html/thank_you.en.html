Dear {{ first_name }},

Dear donor,
{% endif %}
</p>

<p>I feel so lucky to get to be the person to thank you for your {{ (currency ~ " " ~ amount) | l10n_currency(locale) }} {% if recurring %}monthly {% endif %}gift, on behalf of a world of people seeking free knowledge.</p>

{% if recurring %}
<p>Your donation keeps Wikipedia independent, and your monthly support is essential for long-term planning, helping us see what Wikipedia can achieve in the years ahead. Once a month, a donation of {{ (currency ~ " " ~ amount) | l10n_currency(locale) }} will be debited by the Wikimedia Foundation until you notify us to stop. <b>We will send you a summary each January of your contributions for the previous year.</b> If for whatever reason you wish to cancel your donation, follow these <a href="https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:LandingCheck?landing_page=Cancel_or_change_recurring_giving&basic=true&language={{ locale }}">easy cancellation instructions</a>.</p>
{% endif %}

{% if "RecurringRestarted" in contribution_tags %}
<p>We recently resolved a small technical issue which paused some monthly recurring donations. We have reinstated your recurring donation, and it will process normally going forward. We will not charge you for the months that were skipped. Thank you for your patience and your support, and please feel free to email donate@wikimedia.org if you have any questions.</p>
{% endif %}

{% if "UnrecordedCharge" in contribution_tags %}
<p>We recently resolved a technical issue which caused a small number of donors to not receive a confirmation of their donation. Please accept this email as a thank you for your donation on {{ receive_date }}. We truly appreciate your patience and your support, and please feel free to email donate@wikimedia.org if you have any questions.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>I used to try to guess what motivated you to give, but the longer I do this work, the more I realize I canâ€™t put your curiosity in a box. There is no one singular experience of Wikipedia. Curiosity is as diverse as we all are, and it looks a little different for each of us.</p>

<p>When you use Wikipedia next, I hope you feel that it belongs to you. Because without you, and without the millions of people who come back to us every day, we would be nothing.</p>

<p><b>Thank you for giving Wikipedia shape, and purpose, and momentum. Thank you for fitting us into your life.</b></p>

<p>With immense gratitude,</p>

<p>
Katherine
