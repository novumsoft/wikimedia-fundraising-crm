<p>Thank you for your donation of {{ (currency ~ " " ~ amount) | l10n_currency(locale) }} to the Wikimedia Foundation. The Wikimedia Foundation is the non-profit organization that supports Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects. Our mission is to build the most accessible and comprehensive source of free knowledge in the world.</p>

<p>{% if "UnrecordedCharge" in contribution_tags %} We recently resolved a technical issue which caused a small number of donors to not receive a confirmation of their donation.

<p>We believe that knowledge is a fundamental human right. As humanity rushes into our digital future, we need open, accessible, public spaces to access knowledge online. Wikimedia is such a space. Wikipedia delivers free knowledge to people, by people, in hundreds of languages around our planet.</p>

<p>Over the course of a year, Wikipedia is edited and read by people on every continent, including Antarctica. Nearly half a billion people visit Wikipedia every month for everything from preserving cultural heritage, to improving cancer detection, to researching homework. They come to learn. They stay and discover.</p>

<p>Everyone is a potential Wikipedian. If you don't find what you're looking for on Wikipedia, you can start <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:UserLogin?type=signup&amp;campaign=lila2015">start creating it yourself</a>. The articles, words, pictures and data are created by a diverse community of people who volunteer to share their knowledge with the world.</p>

<p>Every day, we ask ourselves how we can increase our impact, and ensure Wikipedia and its sister projects are even more accurate, rich, and accessible tomorrow than they are today. Your donation will help us get there.</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping us growing and impacting lives another year.</p>
