<p>Dear donor,</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Thank you for your invaluable gift of bringing knowledge to every human around the world.</p>

{% if "RecurringRestarted" in contribution_tags %}<p> We recently resolved a small technical issue
which paused some monthly recurring donations. We have reinstated your recurring donation, and it
will process normally going forward. We will not charge you for the months that were skipped. Thank
you for your patience and your support, and please feel free to email donate@wikimedia.org if you
have any questions. </p>{% endif %}

<p>My name is Lila Tretikov, and I’m the Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation. Over the
past year, gifts like yours powered our efforts to expand the encyclopedia in 287 languages and to
make it more accessible all over the world. We strive most to impact those who would not have access
to education otherwise. We bring knowledge to people like Akshaya Iyengar from Solapur, India.
Growing up in this small textile manufacturing town, she used Wikipedia as her primary learning
source. For students in these areas, where books are scarce but mobile Internet access exists,
Wikipedia is instrumental. Akshaya went on to graduate from college in India and now works as a
software engineer in the United States. She credits Wikipedia with powering half of her
knowledge.</p>

<p>This story is not unique. Our mission is lofty and presents great challenges. Most people who use
Wikipedia are surprised to hear it is run by a non-profit organization and funded by your donations.
Each year, just enough people donate to keep the sum of all human knowledge available for everyone.
Thank you for making this mission possible.</p>

<p>On behalf of half a billion people who read Wikipedia, thousands of volunteer editors, and staff
at the Foundation, I thank you for keeping Wikipedia online and ad-free this year.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br/>
Lila</p>
