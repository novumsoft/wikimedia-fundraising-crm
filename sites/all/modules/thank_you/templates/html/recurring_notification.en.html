<p>Dear donor,</p>
{%endif%}
<p>I’m so impressed by you, I had to email you twice. You did something extraordinary: you donated, and then decided to set up an additional {{ (currency ~ " " ~ amount) | l10n_currency(locale) }} sustaining gift on top of that. This donation will be debited on or around the {{ day_of_month }} of the month, until you ask us to stop.</p>
<p>Your ongoing support will sustain us, at an unprecedented moment of growth for Wikipedia and its sister projects. Your gift shows me that you understand how valuable this free knowledge resource that we’ve nurtured together really is.</p>
<p>And your commitment to us is matched by our commitment to you. We will always be free. We will always be neutral. And we will always treat your donation as an investment, putting it to work so that Wikipedia will be a resource you can count on forever.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Katherine</p>
