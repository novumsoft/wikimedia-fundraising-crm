  <p>I love that it’s my job to thank you for your {$amount|crmMoney:$currency} contribution to Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Endowment.
  </p>

  <p><b>Wikipedia is possible because of a powerful idea: that people, like you and me, can participate in building the world’s knowledge and making it freely available to everyone, everywhere.</b>
  </p>

  <p>Today, thanks to the support of millions of volunteer contributors and supporters, you can wander Wikipedia for hours. With more than 40 million articles, Wikipedia can answer almost any question, and take you places you’ve never been. The Wikimedia Endowment will make sure future generations have access to Wikipedia like we do today, for years to come.
  </p>

  <p>The essential story of Wikipedia is the story of an individual, like you, giving a little bit of themselves to keep the doors of discovery open. Wikipedia will continue to evolve, grow, and meet new challenges because of the generosity of people like you.
  </p>

  <p>Wikipedia is yours: yours to read, yours to edit, yours in which to get lost. We’re not the destination, we’re the beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for helping free knowledge thrive.
  </p>

  <p>I love that it’s my job to thank you for your {$amount|crmMoney:$currency} contribution to Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.</p>

  <p>The essential story of Wikipedia is the story of an individual, like you, giving a little bit of themselves to keep the doors of discovery open. Your contribution shows me that the spirit of our vision is alive and well.</p>

  <p>You probably donated because Wikipedia is useful to you. That’s one of the main reasons people tell me when I ask them why they support Wikipedia. But what may surprise you is that one of the top reasons people don’t give is because they can’t afford to.</p>

  <p>At the Wikimedia Foundation, we believe that no one should have to pay to learn. We believe knowledge should always be free. We will never charge anyone to use Wikipedia. So how do we afford the infrastructure of one of the world’s most popular websites?</p>

  <p>Because of the generosity of people like you.</p>

  <p>Wikipedia is yours: yours to read, yours to edit, yours in which to get lost. We’re not the destination, we’re the beginning.</p>

  <p>Thank you for helping free knowledge thrive.</p>
