Thank you for your support of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation. Your contribution of {$amount|crmMoney:$currency} supports Wikipedia and helps secure the future of free knowledge for everyone.

I love that it’s my job to thank you for your {$amount|crmMoney:$currency} contribution to Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.

The essential story of Wikipedia is the story of an individual, like you, giving a little bit of themselves to keep the doors of discovery open. Your contribution shows me that the spirit of our vision is alive and well.

You probably donated because Wikipedia is useful to you. That’s one of the main reasons people tell me when I ask them why they support Wikipedia. But what may surprise you is that one of the top reasons people don’t give is because they can’t afford to.

At the Wikimedia Foundation, we believe that no one should have to pay to learn. We believe knowledge should always be free. We will never charge anyone to use Wikipedia. So how do we afford the infrastructure of one of the world’s most popular websites?

Because of the generosity of people like you.

Wikipedia is yours: yours to read, yours to edit, yours in which to get lost. We’re not the destination, we’re the beginning.

Thank you for helping free knowledge thrive.

Katherine
