Dear {{name}},

I am thrilled that this email to you is one of the first things on my to-do list in {{year + 1}}. Granted, that to-do list is long--Wikipedia has so many amazing projects on the horizon--but thanking you is at the very top.

Your hard earned money pays our bills, runs our servers, and helps us recruit the world's smartest people to ensure that Wikipedia will always be a resilient, neutral source for learning.

Outside of those practical details, your donations are deeply meaningful to we who work to serve you. Your donations show us that our work matters, and is worth supporting. Thank you.

Hereâ€™s a summary of all the donations you made to the Wikimedia Foundation in {{year}}.
