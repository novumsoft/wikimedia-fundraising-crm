Add code and test to move over mailing provider data when we permanently delete a contact

Once we permanently delete a contact we lose the information that would allow us to transfer mailing provider data to a new contact.

This fix is intended to allow us to start deleting deleted contacts again knowing we will be not be losing this data and in fact will be
making it more correct as we delete. At some point in the future we may not need this if our new code is moving on merge reliably
